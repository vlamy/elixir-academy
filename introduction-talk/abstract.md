You might have heard of that language « Elixir ».., everybody's saying it's great, but few are the ones who claim to have pushed code in production with it. The promises of Elixir are : high fault-tolerance, non-mandatory functional style, concurrency by design, metaprogramming... Actually, Elixir is quite young (first release in 2011 by José Valim), but it is strongly coupled to Erlang, a battle tested technology coming from the eighties. The purpose of this talk is to give you the quintessence of Elixir (and the underlying Erlang layer). The quintessence means explaining the fundamentals of this technology, and show what it is good (the best ?) at. To reach that purpose I'm proposing in this talk to revisit the foundations of Erlang and directly transition to minutely chosen Elixir code samples, play with them... and let the magic happen ! Hopefully, after this talk you will understand why Elixir have been born and for what usage you should give it a try or not.
